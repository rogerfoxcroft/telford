<p>Bert's account of the long gardens of the houses in Glasshouse Row reminds me of Grasmere Road, Lancaster, and I wonder if they were there for the same reason. During the last century, one of the Electoral Reform Acts gave the vote to any housholder with a freehold worth forty shillings per year; whereupon the Whig party built a number of houses with that value of land, to be sold to party supporters.</p>
