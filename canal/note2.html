<h3>Note 2</h3>

<p>Glebe land was originally farmed by the Rector of a parish for his own sustenance. Later, it was more often let and the Rector was entitled to the rents (unlike a Vicar, who was not). However, the Rector often had to pay for the upkeep of the chancel of the church out of the proceeds. About fifteen years ago this led to considerable disquiet in the village of Shifnal, when major repairs to the chancel were needed, and question was raised whether householders of properties built on the Glebe were legally bound to pay for them.</p>

<p>As far as I know, they were never asked to do so!</p>
