	<h1>Hollinswood to Oakengates</h1>
</div>

<p>All of this section is guesswork. One end is given by the position of the
path along the top of Randlay Pool; the other, not very precisely,  by the known
former existence of a tunnel under Holyhead Road near the Greyhound pub.
However, it appears clearly on the Wrockwardine Wood Parish  map. This map
clearly predates both the railway and Telford's realignment of the London -
Holyhead road. Comparison of the line with the David and Charles map shows that
the railway followed the canal through this section as far as the Greyhound,
just as it did in the northerly part of the Aqueduct to Hollinswood stretch.
</p>

<p>It is possible to postulate a line for the canal which runs just to the west
of St Quentin roundabout; follows the contour crossing Dale Acre Way; skirting
the back of houses on the west side of Downmead; crossing Dale Acre Way again
and going forward more-or-less straight to Hollinsgate Roundabout. From there,
there is one route through the pass between Ketley Bank and Snedshill, and
everything in history follows it: the canal, a railway built over it and another
one still in use, and roads ancient and modern. Where, under all this tarmac,
was the canal? Your guess is as good as mine.
</p>

<p>There was a <a href="b67.html">tunnel</a> under Snedshill. Before that point,
the now-lost railway, which replaced the canal, crossed over the other, still
working, Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury line. The tunnel used by both canal and
railway must have passed under Telford's later Holyhead Road; the railway then
beginning its descent and passing under Canongate through the <a href=
"b69.html">bridge</a> which remains there, but the canal following the contour
more to the east and crossing Canongate where the Queensway now does so. </p>

<p>The maps suggests it ran east of the Greyhound pub, and the junction for the
Ketley arm would have been near Canongate. The Ketley arm may have crossed Lion
Street where there is a white <a href="b68.html">gate</a> in a wall at the top,
just below the Greyhound.
