	<h1>Muxton Bridge to Pave Lane</h1>
</div>

<p>Although much of this canal has disappeared entirely, it is shown on my 1921
map, and enough short stretches (mostly much less than a hundred yards),
names and bridges are still visible to establish its course with certainty.</p>

<p>From the public car park at the Muxton Lane end of the Granville Country
Part, the canal crossed Muxton Lane, turning sharp right parallel to the
road. Was there a wharf and a warehouse here? It seems probable that there
would have been, and existing buildings are aligned along the line of the
canal.</p>

<p>Passing <a href="pics/muxton1.jpg">behind the golf club car park</a> at the end of Muxton Lane as a dry ditch, the canal (which weaves markedly here, as can be seen on several
maps) turns right again along the track to the start of the Silver Course:
part of this is <a href="pics/muxton3.jpg">in water</a>. At the groundsman's hut the path turns right, the canal continues. <a href="pics/muxton4.jpg">Several short stretches</a> remain as water features on the course, whilst several hundred yards of <a href="pics/muxton5.jpg">dry bed</a> run
alongside the path through the trees from the top corner of the driving
range.</p>

<p>From there the canal ran straight to <a href="pics/abbeybr.jpg">Abbey Farm bridge</a>, although I think nothing remains - certainly the landowners do not encourage exploration.
The bridge stands, with a stretch of dry bed beyond it, the Lilleshall
Abbey forming a romantic backdrop. Then, after passing abbey and farm, the
canal turns due north to <a href="pics/hughbr.jpg">Hugh's Bridge</a> - once again, no traces remain on the way.</p>

<p>But at <a href="pics/hughbr.jpg">Hugh's Bridge</a> there is another section of dry canal. There is a drive alongside, and a hundred yards along that a public footpath to the left
marks the junction and start of the <a href="hughlill.html">Lilleshall branch</a>, via an
inclined plane. On the current 1:25,000 map the bed is shown as going on for
several hundred yards further, but the way, once again, is marked Private.</p>

<p>The next clue is the name, <i>Little Hales Bridge</i>, a mile North of Lilleshall
Hall on the 1:25,000 map; and near here, across a track from a perfectly
flat and smooth arable field, a short section in water runs through a belt
of trees, converging on the [pic to follow] Lilleshall Hall carriage drive, where it ends.</p>

<p>That is the end of the canal on the 1921 map, apart from a short section
beyond Pitchcroft Lane: probably, it continued more-or-less straight on to
that point, crossing the drive at an oblique angle. I was once told that
the carriage drive was constructed on the canal: in general, not so,
although maybe for a couple of hundred yards at this point it was. 
<a href="lilpond1.jpg">This pond</a> beside the drive <a href="lilpond2.jpg">(another view)</a> may be a remnant of it.</p>Imagelink

<p>Approaching Pitchford Lane across another ploughed field with no trace
remaining, the canal passed under a <a href="pics/pitchfbf.jpg">brick bridge</a>, a few hundred yards
east of Croft Farm, and beyond the bridge, the hundred yards shown on the
1921 map has become a water feature in someone's garden.</p>

<p>The next section is untraceable, although a path from here to Pave Lane must
indicate the approximate route, and the presence of a <a href="pics/pavela.jpg">building</a> at right angles to the road indicates where the canal ended at a wharf on the
Newport - Wolverhampton road.</p>
