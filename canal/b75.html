<h1>The Old Canals of Telford</h1>

<h2>Trench Inclined Plane</h2>

	<br>Trench Inclined Plane was in use until the 1920s, and there are several photos of it. The <em>Blue Pig</em> at its foot remains, but everything else has been destroyed by modern development. An earlier photo from this point shows a forest of factory chimneys beyond the foot of the incline.
