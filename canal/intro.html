<h3>How I got interested</h3>

<p>As a small boy, I remember being fascinated by the Macclesfield canal near
my home, and the Lancaster canal near my grandmother's. As a teenager, I walked
along lengths of the Macclesfield canal, wondering what it would be like to be
in a boat and envying those people (relatively few in those days) who were.

<p>On coming to Telford, I learned that there had once been an extensive canal
network, almost all of which had vanished. I was interested, but for ten years
did nothing about it. I knew that the Silkin Way between Town Park and Madeley
is the line of an old railway, and I had read in the Ironbridge Gorge Museum
that the railway was built on the bed of the canal.

<p> Then, in August 1996, my parents came on a visit, went for a walk and got
lost. On their eventual return, they asked a great many questions about the
railway and canal network, most of which I couldn't answer. In particular, my
father asked where the Aqueduct had been. I told them what I had been told
locally, and never questioned - &quot;It's still there - the big bridge opposite
the Britannia&quot;. To which they retorted that it couldn't be - the path above
was sloping. Now of course, you can't build a canal on a slope - all the water
would fall out at the bottom. So at that point at least, the railway was not
built on the canal bed.

<p>So I started exploring. I got more and more fascinated, and decided to find
out what remained of the whole system. At the same time, I wanted to do
something about my increasing corpulence, so this was to be an exercise in
exploration, not in research in libraries. Naturally, I ran the risk of making
mistakes which proper research would avoid. This is not an academic research
paper, and much of what I have learned, deduced or guessed must be recorded in
the county's libraries and archives, and be already well known to local
historians. That's not the point - I wanted to find out for myself by
exploration. Nevertheless, as time went on I accumulated a certain amount of
paperwork - see Sources.

<p>It has been (and still is) enormous fun, and the comments I have received via my guestbook from people who have enjoyed viewing <i>Explofing Telford</i> have been an ample reward for the  effort of recording
it.

<a name="sources"></a>
<h3>Sources</h3>

<p>I have not researched this exploration as a historian should, nor cited my
sources properly. However, for those interested, I have used for my assistance:

<ul>
	<li><cite>Barrie Trinder's</cite> pioneering book, <u>The Industrial Revolution in Shropshire.</u></li>
	<li><cite>Richard Morriss</cite>, <u>The Canals of Shropshire</u>
	<li>Modern OS maps of 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 scale</li>
	<li>Older <u>OS one-inch maps of 1921</u> and <u>1953</u></li>
	<li>The official <u>Telford Street Map</u></li>
	<li><cite>David and Charles</cite>, reprint of an <u>OS one-inch map of 1814-1869</u></li>
	<li><cite>The Godfrey Edition</cite> reprints of several OS maps of 1:2500 scale of 1901-1911</li>
	<li>A map in <u>Documents Concerning the Parish of Wrockwardine with Wrockwardine Wood</u>, published by the <cite>Local Studies Library</cite>, Shrewsbury, 1987. This map is undated and unscaled, but predates both the railways and Telford's new London - Holyhead road.</li>
	<li>Part of an OS 1:25,000 map sent to me by Tony Clayton, showing the Coalbrookdale section and parts of the Coalport and Aqueduct sections.</li>
	<li>The knowledge of my colleagues Dai Morgan and Trevor Dart, in the history department of Wrockwardine Wood School (NB - I am not in the history dept) and materials they have lent me.</li>
	<li>Information sent to me by too many readers, now, to name them all here, but to all of whom I am extremely grateful.</li>
</ul>

<a name="scope"></a>
<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>This is a survey of where the canals ran, and a description of where
sections or traces can still be seen - and no more. Those interested in the
history of their construction, use and decline will not find answers here, but
they are not hard to come by in the local libraries and museums.

<a name="accuracy"></a>
<h3>Accuracy</h3>

<p>Although I make no pretensions that this is an academic paper, and have not
included all my evidence (in particular, citations of written sources), I wish
to avoid wilfully misleading anyone.

<p>Three kinds of statement will be found in this account:

<ul>
	<li>Where something is stated as a fact, it will be &quot;provable&quot; by reference to a map, a published book by a reputable historian or by incontrovertible evidence on the ground. It may still be wrong, however - eminent historians would be the first to admit that they may be mistaken, and evidence can be misinterpreted - especially by a novice like me. </li>
	<li>Where a possibility, probability or deduction is given, I am so far confident that the fact is as stated, on the basis of what I have seen. </li>
	<li>Some statements are given as speculation or guesswork, and are just that. They are my best guess, without supporting evidence, of how the canal ran between two known (or deduced) points. </li>
</ul>

<a name="corrections"></a>
<h3>Corrections</h3>

<p>I have made many mistakes. The ones I know I have made have been corrected
(although some have been perpetuated in <a href="stories.html">Stories of the Hunt</a>). If anyone can
point out to me any further bludners, or traces I have missed, I would be
delighted to be told. <a href="http://www.telfordsites.co.uk/mailto.html">Please mail me!</a>

<a name="places"></a>
<h2>Identifying places by modern names</h2>

<p>All street names and other references will be found on the Telford Street
Map published by Wrekin District Council, unless otherwise stated. Of course,
nearly all will be newer than the canal, so for example, &quot;it crossed Queen
Street&quot; should be read as &quot;it crossed where Queen Street is
now&quot;.
