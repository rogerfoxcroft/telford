<p><cite>This is a transcript of a tape sent to me by Bert because of my interest 
in the old canals in the Telford area (<a href="contents.html" target="_top">see here</a>), and is in the main his account of how the Muxton to Trench arm looked in the early years of the century.</cite>

<p><cite>I have edited it as little as possible to preserve the freshness
of Bert's words; but I have taken the liberty of moving some material which 
he added at the end to its due place in the narrative, and have removed the 
small hesitations and repetitions which are acceptable and inevitable in 
speech but undesirable in print.</cite>

<p><cite>Some few additional notes and clarifications of my own are in [square 
brackets].</cite>

<h2>The Canal</h2>

<p>I have tried to paint a rough and quick picture of what the
[Wrockwardine Wood] canal used to be, from when I was a boy, through the 
First World War and until I left in 1940 to go in the army. I was 
commissioned in the Royal Engineers in 1940 and I didn't come back from the 
Middle East until 1945, and I only stayed about a year in Shropshire; so my 
knowledge of the canal stopped about then.</p>

<p>I think if I do a quick walk along the canal and tell you what it was 
like many years ago it will give you a much better idea of how things went, 
starting at Muxton Bridge and walking towards Lilleshall. That particular 
part of the canal was derelict when I was born in 1908; but from there on it 
started to buck up until it reached the large building we know as the Big 
Engine. Now the Big Engine was a pumping engine which pumped fresh water out 
of the mines into the canal. That means that the canal was always full to 
overflowing, and of course was very good for fish; but it only went from 
there onwards towards Wrockwardine Wood, it didn't go back into 
Lilleshall.</p>

<p>If we walk on now from the Big Engine through the Donnington area towards 
Wrockwardine Wood we shall go underneath a road [St Georges Road] and 
eventually come to what was known as the Wide Hole, quite a large open sheet 
of water. Now it's my feeling that the reason it was a large sheet of water 
was so that the boats could be turned round. Now why should you turn round 
boats when it was a straight canal? So was that where the [canal from the 
Wrockwardine Wood] incline joined up? There is no possible way of finding 
out because in between the bottom of the incline and the Wide Hole is pit 
mounds now, and all covered in, so your chance of ever finding a route there 
is pretty much out of the question.</p>

<p>Anyway, a little way from the Wide Hole  the canal turns sharp left and 
goes underneath a bridge which spans the canal from what is known as the 
cinder hill across to the other side where there is another large building 
which was originally a winding engine, well before my time so that dates 
back into the last century. Since then it's been turned into a house, but 
the deep area inside the building obviously was where the rope went, winding 
up and down the cage. On the top of the Cinder Hill is what's known as the 
Central Hall. It's a small chapel which was originally the isolation 
hospital.</p>

<p>Right, come back to the canal. Go straight on in a wide arc over to the 
right, then sharp left you come to Furnace Lane. The canal goes under the 
bridge of Furnace Lane. On the right was a grocer's shop, Charlie Evans, and 
on the left was a Fish and Chip Shop [now the Victorian Fryer]. That takes 
you to Canal Side. Now looking across the canal to the other side, the field 
there was [later Sir Gordon] Richards' field where he kept his horses and 
ponies.</p>

<p>Walk along Canal Side then continue on until you come to Wade Road and of 
course houses. This was formerly the football field for Wrockwardine Wood 
Football Club, and it was owned by Jim Wade who ran the White Horse pub.</p>

<p>Starting there, the edge of the tow path is all brickwork, not just rough 
but very very well bricked. It must have been very costly even in the early 
days: they were very high class bricks, not just any rough bricks, and it 
was very good, and of course that particular part of the canal was always 
clean.</p>

<a name="back1"></a>

<p>The edge of the canal continues on from the football field until you come 
to the Rectory garden. The garden reaches right up to the Rectory which 
stands on Church Road. But on the right hand side before you get to the 
Rectory garden was Glasshouse Square, ten houses in a square; and backing on 
to those was Glasshouse Row, of nineteen houses. No 1 at this end as we 
approach it, is where I was born. The gardens of those houses ran almost 
down into Furnace Lane. They are enormous gardens, all of them. [<a 
href="note1.html">Note 1</a>] They all had a pig sty each because people 
kept their own pigs there.</p>

<a name="back2"></a>

<p>Between the Rectory garden and Church Road, over on the other side, is 
the Glebe Field [<a href="note2.html">Note 2</a>] belonging to the church; I
suppose during the 1930s, there was a building built as a meeting place for 
the church; but when I was there there was nothing on the Glebe Field.</p>

<p>On the right hand side, where in my day were allotments, at the turn oF 
the century was a glass factory which made green glass, hence the names 
&quot;Glasshouse Row&quot; and &quot;Glasshouse Square&quot;. Quite regularly when you were 
digging in the garden you would turn up lumps of green glass. The pity is 
that we just threw them all away. Now they would be real antique pieces of 
glass dating into the last century, but to us they were nothing.</p>

<p>Glasshouse Row ran right down to No 19 where the Church of England School 
used to be, backing on to the churchyard and the church; and that's the 
school I used to go to when I was three years old. In fact I left it when I 
was six and went to what we called the Board School - Shropshire County 
Council Education Board - which is further in towards Oakengates on the 
hill. It's ceased to be a school for a long time because the school now is 
on the way to Oakengates -  the new school further along the new road [<a 
href="http://www.wws.wrekin.sch.uk">Wrockwardine Wood Arts College</a>, New Road].</p>

<p>It's interesting to know that some time after that school was built, in 
the playing fields a large hole appeared. It was a mine shaft which hadn't 
been filled in, it had just been covered over. Fortunately nobody was there 
and nobody was hurt.</p>

<p>My grandparents and parents and other members of the family are buried in 
Wrockwardine Wood churchyard. The two windows at the front end are 
[memorials] to my mother and father.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the canal, which now runs past the Rectory garden and 
goes in a straight line towards the bridge at Church Road.</p>

<p>Having got to Church Road, remembering that the whole of the edge of the 
canal is brickwork still, we come to the mill. The mill is Bullock's Flour 
Mill, which has been there since the beginning of the century. In my early 
days the canal was navigable up to the mill, and grain used to come up in 
long boats which were unloaded for the mill, and there was a crane there to 
lift the bags of grain out. There was always some spill of grain so needless 
to say it was a good place for young fish.</p>

<p>The canal had a lot of fish in it - roach, perch, tench, pike - so there 
was always some fishing going on with the kids - not very successfully, but 
the odd fish was caught now and again.</p>

<p>Now the mill belonged to the Bullock family for many years. It's 
interesting to know that in the church the Eastern window is to one of the 
Bullock family, and in the church yard are two large monuments to members of 
the family.</p>

<p>Leaving the mill and walking on towards Teagues Bridge you then go under 
a small bridge [Church Road] which connects what became the recreation 
ground and the motte (or the moat). The canal then continues in a wide 
half-circle so that it is possible to walk from the bridge that I mentioned 
on a straight line and rejoin the canal again on the other side via a 
footpath. There was a disused mine on there, but the interesting bit about 
going on that footpath was there was a freshwater stream which never froze 
over, it just kept running all the time, and in it was watercress, 
stickleybacks and newts. Well of course, they're long since gone, 
unfortunately.</p>

<p>Reaching Teagues Bridge [Wombridge Road]: the bridge connects by road 
down to the Trench, and on the other side on to Wombridge and Oakengates 
[now bisected by Wrockwardine Wood Way]. That road is pretty rough, or was 
in my day, and of course there is a pub up there as well, on Teagues Bridge 
[since replaced].</p>

<p>From Teagues Bridge you then go fairly straight to the end of the canal 
where there is an overflow, because there was water running all the time, 
and that's where the [Trench] Inclined came with two vehicles, one up and 
one down, conveying the boats from the canal at the top to the canal at the 
bottom which is in between the Trench Pool and the Shropshire Ironworks 
[Trench Lock industrial estate]. The incline was still working at the 
beginning of the First World War: I had a ride on it, and I've seen boats 
come up those vehicles on that incline from one level of the canal to the 
other.</p>

<p>Well from the end of the canal by Shropshire Ironworks is Trench Lock, 
which of course is now filled in. The canal used to go underneath the main 
road there, and on the right hand side was a brick building which housed the 
clerks of the railway goods office. One of the clerks was actually in my 
form at the High school.</p>

<p>(When I was ten, at the second school, I took a scholarship, because I'd 
already reached the top standard, Standard 7. I took a scholarship and went 
to Wellington High School. I walked to Trench Crossing station which is not 
far from Trench Lock and went by train every morning, until I was sixteen. I 
was of course one of the youngest in the class, being still ten in the 
September - I was eleven in the October.)</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the Trench Lock. There is no sign of the canal at that 
particular piece, but it used to run underneath [Trench] road and continue 
on and swing right round Sankeys Steelworks. Sankey's Steelworks, [later] 
Gesteen and Nettlefold's, part of the big combine, [is now GKN Sankey]; but 
in my day it was owned by the Sankey family. The canal continues on, and 
eventually, getting down as far as Kinnersley, joins what we used to call 
the &quot;bottom canal&quot;, which is the canal which joins Stafford and Shrewsbury. 
I'll mention that in a moment, but that gives you an idea of what is 
virtually the end of the Wrockwardine Wood section. Of course the whole 
section and the bottom canal as well is all part of the Shropshire Union 
Canal, properly speaking. In fact if you go back to the bridge near the 
mill, in the road there was a brick pillar, on which was carveD 
<em>S.U.By</em> - Shropshire Union Boundary: in other words, the boundary of 
the canal lay where that concrete post was.</p>

<h2>The Humber Arm</h2>

<p>Now if I can leave Wrockwardine Wood canal and take you to another one: 
if you leave Trench and go towards Newport you eventually come on the right 
hand side to Farm Lane [replaced by Wrekin Drive] and on the left hand side 
a very small road leading underneath what was the London and North Western 
railway (Shrewsbury - Stafford). In my young days there was a railway line 
that ran down there, in between all the fields, but nowadays the whole area 
is the BoD Ordnance Depot, which was moved from the Woolwich Arsenal in the 
late 1930s, just before the war, and set up in Donnington. This railway ran 
through there for I suppose about three quarters of a mile until you came to 
the end of what was known as the Humber Arm of the canal. It was an arm of 
the main Stafford - Shrewsbury canal, and when I was a schoolboy there was 
an awful lot of canal traffic. At the end of Humber Arm was a quay, well 
maintained with chutes and cranes to shoot coal into the long boats for the 
canal, and also of course there were stables there for the horses, because 
the canal boats were all pulled by horses.</p>

<p>The Humber Arm all was well-maintained: in fact the weeds were kept cut 
and there was always an overflow of water. I'm not sure where the water came 
from, whether some of it came out of the pits further up or was pumped in at 
Stafford - it could well be from one of the Stafford pits - but it was 
certainly full of fresh water at all times, and of course lots and lots of 
fish, so there was plenty of fishing going on there.</p>

<p>The Humber Arm joined the main canal by another wide sheet of water and a 
small steel aqueduct crossing the road running down from Donnington to 
Kinnersley. It was strange to see because it was so arranged that the canal 
could be shut off there. At that aqueduct there were slots in the brickwork 
at the sides to drop wooden beams in to shut one section of the canal off so
that it could be cleaned and kept navigable. [A similar arrangement may be 
seen on the stretch of canal within Blists Hill Museum.]</p>

<p>Between the two wars the canal was in full use with long boats which we 
now call canal &quot;narrowboats&quot;, but we used to call them &quot;house boats&quot; because 
people lived on them.</p>

<h3>About the Cockshutt</h3>

<p>The road running down underneath the old [Wrockwardine Wood] incline was a railway running from somewhere near St Georges and presumably joining the canal. It is known as the <a href="bits.html#Cockshutt" target="_top">&quot;pig rails&quot;</a> because it carried, not pigs as porkers, but pig iron from the blast furnaces. There was a lot of ironwork going on: it was a real black area with dozens and dozens of mines.</p>

<a name="mineclose"></a>
<h3>On Mine Closures</h3>

<p>The first one to be closed was the Freehold (?), the second was the 
Grange pit. That only left the Granville working, and that worked for a time 
and then that closed. The old idea was that you weren't allowed to mine 
under special areas like reservoirs or canals or main road or anything like 
that: you had to skirt them or leave the block of coal underneath there so 
that there would be no subsidence. But when the Second World War came along, 
of course all that was swept aside and mining continued just about 
everywhere, including underneath Lilleshall Abbey, so the abbey - or what 
was left of it - suddenly started to tilt over and had to be all shored up, 
which was a great pity.<p>
