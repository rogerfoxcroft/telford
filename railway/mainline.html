	<h1>The Main Line</h1>
	<h5>From the South via Madeley Junction and Wellington to Shrewsbury</h5>
	<h3>Great Western and London North Western Joint Railways</h3>
</div>
	    
<p>This line is still open and therefore cannot be walked; but is for the same reason the only line that can actually be travelled by train. It is  the main line from Birmingham to Telford and Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>Approaching from London, Birmingham and Shifnal, the traveller enters Telford at <a href="pics/madlyjct.jpg">Madeley Junction</a>, on Stafford Park just north of Naird Roundabout and visible from the bridge there. The left hand fork carries coal to Ironbridge Power Station; the right is the main line going forward to Shrewsbury, calling at Telford Central (which is new), Oakengates, New Hadley (but no longer - there was a halt there) and Wellington.</p>

<p>The new station at <a href="pics/telstn.jpg">Telford Central</a> is an uninspiring cheap construction without even a clock, although it does now have a snack bar. ("They" want us to believe that Public Transport matters; but the Victorians really believed that it did. Compare this station with <a href="pics/sbystn.jpg">Shrewsbury's</a>.)</p>

<p>After that, there is a short <a href="pics/ogtunl.jpg">tunnel</a> before <a href="pics/ogatstn2.jpg">Oakengates Station</a>, recently smartened up. There used to be extensive sidings (and a coal yard?) here, but now it is an unmanned station at which only the most-stopping trains call. The former station building has become a dental surgery.</p>

<p>The fine bridge at the bottom or Market Street, Oakengates is, says Dave Cromarty,</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><cite>an original Shrewsbury & Birmingham Railway bridge in Oakengates (bottom of Market Street) which bears a cast iron plate 'Lilleshall Company Fect. 1848'.</cite></p>
	<p><cite>The goods yard in Oakengates had two sidings for Castle Cement until very recent years. I can't remember when they were closed but certainly they were still there when the 'Donnington Farewell' ran on 6.7.91.</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proceeding in a westerly direction towards Wellington, there was at New Hadley from 1934. I have a friend who remembers trains stopping at Hadley Halt as late as 1978-80, and Dave Cromarty was on the last train to stop there on 13th May, 1985 - despite which <a href="pics/hadhalt.jpg">nothing remains of it</a>.</p>

<p>Next, about three quarters of a mile from Wellington, and behind what is now Furrows Car Sales parking area, came the <a href="pics/weltnjct.jpg">junction</a> with the Shropshire Union line to Newport.</p>

<p>We are now <a href="pics/wtnstapp.jpg">approaching</a> (I included this pic just because I like it, poor quality though it is) the large and formerly busy station at the once-important, and still flourishing, market town of <a href="pics/weltnsta.jpg">Wellington</a> - its importance attested by the number of platforms and tracks. Past the station in Wellington, were sidings and a coalyard, still in business when I came to Shropshire twenty years ago, and a small locomotive yard; and past that, the <a href="pics/mkt-djct.jpg">junction</a> with the Market Drayton line going north. The main line is in the cutting to the right of the picture; the tarmac path is the Market Drayton line.</p>

<p>The main line continues west, calling at Admaston on the way to Shrewsbury, where the <a href="pics/admastn.jpg">platform</a> and a house called <a href="pics/admoldst.jpg"><em>Old Station House</em></a> can still be seen. (The site of another former station at Upton Magna, on the north side of the track on the Upton Magna - Berwick Wharf lane, is visible from the A5 just west of  the two canal bridges, the station building being now Old Station House.)</p>
