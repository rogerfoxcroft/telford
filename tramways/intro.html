<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In 1966, Bertram Baxter's 
book <em>Stone Blocks and Iron Rails (Tramroads)</em> was published as 
part of <em>The Industrial Archaeology of the British Isles</em> series. Before 
this book appeared, very little had been written about waggonways and 
tramroads and Baxter's book, the result of many years research, not 
only opened up an area of previously overlooked transport history, it 
inspired others to take an interest too. I did, and whenever I turn 
my attention to a new tramroad my first point of reference is the gazetteer 
in <em>Stone Blocks</em>. Chapter one of the book begins <em>He who knows 
where to look can sometimes see a dark line beneath the grass that seems 
to enter a field through one gate and leave it by another ...</em> 
During recent years I have followed many dark lines beneath the grass 
(most of which turned out to be nothing whatsoever to do with a tramroad) 
but always with the anticipation that this one, might.
</p>
<p>Baxter's researches 
produced a considerable amount of correspondence and articles. He also 
took photographs and plotted the course of tramways onto 6" maps. 
Much of this material is now held, on behalf of the Railway and Canal 
Historical Society at Birmingham City Council Central Library, in the 
Railway Collection of the Social Sciences department on the fourth floor. 
It is accessible to the public from 9 am to 8 pm, Monday to Friday and 
9 am to 5 pm, Saturday. The member of staff with a particular knowledge 
is Maggie Hanson. Railway Collection Volume 1 is an index and the Baxter 
Collection, Section 7 of the index, comprises maps, bequest boxes (called 
<em>boxes</em>) and files. Confusingly, the boxes have files inside them. 
The maps are labelled 1 to 16, according to county (or groups of counties); 
the bequest boxes include correspondence, notes, research material and 
maps; the files comprise mainly correspondence and photographs. Note: 
there is no correlation between the numbers on the maps, boxes and files. 
It is a treasure-trove for the tramroad enthusiast. For a summary of 
the Railway Collection and other links go to 
<a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/libraries" target="_blank">www.birmingham.gov.uk/libraries</a>
and search for <em>Railway Collection</em> then <em>The Railway Collection 
in Social Sciences</em>.
</p>
<p>Exploring tramroads has 
been a source of considerable pleasure for me over many years. I now 
plan to visit/revisit some of them and update my notes, not as research 
papers but as a record of what remains and a guide for those who, like 
me, enjoy following in the footsteps of Bertram Baxter.</p>
