<h2>History</h2>
<table><tr valign="top"><td>
<p>The Shropshire Canal, 
opened in 1792, formed the main element of the East Shropshire tub-boat 
canal system. By 1796 some of the ironmasters and coal owners of Snedshill 
and Hollinswood were in dispute with the canal company, especially because 
of the tolls for using the canal's inclined planes. As a result, by 
1802 they had built their own tramroad, more or less parallel with the 
canal, to carry their goods to Sutton Wharf on the River Severn, about 
one mile downstream from the Shropshire Canal's wharf at Coalport. 
The tramroad avoided the canal's two inclined planes and provided 
a faster and cheaper means of transporting goods. In 1814, agreement 
was reached with the canal company and the tramroad was dismantled. 
The tramroad is clearly shown on Robert Baugh's 1804 map of Shropshire.
</p>
<p>This tramroad does not 
appear in Bertram Baxter's <em>Stone Blocks and Iron Rails</em> and I 
have found no mention of it in the Baxter Collection in Birmingham Library. 
This is surprising because, though this tramroad was in existence for 
only 12 years, it would seem to have been successful. Although many 
tramroads were built to a riverside wharf, most were built in conjunction 
with a canal. What is unusual about the Sutton Wharf tramroad is that 
it was built in competition with a canal; its success was perhaps an 
early indication of things to come. </p>

<h2>The Route</h2>
<p>Lanes End Cottage is 
at the head of the incline down to Sutton Wharf. To reach the incline, 
retrace your steps to the unmade road signed <em>Sutton Wharf</em>. It 
is marked <em>Private</em> but provides access to a small caravan site. 
100 metres down this unmade road, on the right is a woodland path (not 
a public path) that soon crosses the incline. At this point, looking 
upwards, a slight embankment about 40 metres long ends at the building 
extension at the rear of Lanes End Cottage. Looking downwards is a cutting, 
5 metres wide and up to 8 feet deep which ends after about 120 metres. 
Here an ugly, concrete junction box has been built on the incline through 
which the sewage of Telford is turned through 90 degrees, into two large 
pipes that cross the river to Gitchfield sewage works.
</p>
<p>This point on the incline 
is more that 12 metres above the river. Projecting the line of the incline 
downwards would suggest it terminated not far short of the water's 
edge, close to the stile at the NW corner of the garden of <em>The Cottage</em>. 
Early in the 1960s Barrie Trinder excavated some track at Halesfield. 
He found sandstone blocks and measured the track bed as 1'8" wide. 
The width of the incline would easily allow a double track and I would 
estimate the gradient to be 1 in 5 or 6. Some means of controlling the 
ascending and descending wagons would have been necessary, most likely 
on the spot where Lanes End Cottage now stands <br></p>
<p>Walk down the unmade 
road to Sutton Wharf <b>D</b>. <em>The Cottage</em> is at the riverside. 
It bears a plaque of a badger in relief, an indication that it was once 
part of the Badger estate. Two of the cottage's walls have blind arches 
that might suggest an earlier use. The occupier, who told me he was 
a 78 years old Brummie, was aware of the tramway but knew little about 
it. He believed that the nearby, three storey building dated from the 
1780s and was listed. The building is disused and in danger of becoming 
ruinous. Rectangular in plan, it has a chimney breast at each gable 
end. I saw nothing to suggest it had ever been other than a large house. 
It could not be found on the local authority's register of Listed 
Buildings. Neither could I find any evidence of the wharf itself.

Industrial Revolution in Shropshire</em> in the Ironbridge Institute contains 
Robert Baugh's 1804 map of Shropshire, published in 1808 which clearly 
shows the tramroad running south from Hollinswood via Dawley and Stirchley 
to Sutton Wharf on the River Severn. </p>
