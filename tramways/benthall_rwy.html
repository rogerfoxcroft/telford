<h2>History</h2>
<p>Benthall Railway (sometimes 
referred to as Benthall Rails) is believed to have been in existence 
by 1686. In the late 18th century the New Willey Company used it, as 
an alternative to the Tarbatch Dingle Railway (1), to carry iron to a Severn wharf. At that time 
the line probably ran from New Willey furnace north to near Benthall 
ferry, perhaps to Bower Yard, upstream from the Iron Bridge. (In 1777-80 
the Iron Bridge replaced Benthall ferry as the main crossing of the 
Severn). The southern part of the line probably fell into disuse when 
New Willey Ironworks closed in the early 19th century, but the northern 
section probably took limestone and the products of Benthall's ironworks 
to the river until 1856 or later (2).</p>

<p>A single reference dated 1774: <em>John Wilkinson for 10 tons of melting iron to the bottom of 
Benthall Railway</em>. We must suppose this was another route belonging 
to the Willey Company and presumably starting at Dean Corner (New Willey 
Furnace) to the Severn (3).</p>
<p>This tramroad is not 
mentioned in Bertram Baxter's <em>Stone Blocks and Iron Rails</em>.</p>

<h2>The Route</h2>
<table><tr valign="top"><td>
<p>Bower Yard, on the River 
Severn, is the most likely location for the tramroad wharf. As the tramroad 
course southwards is uncertain it is best to start the walk in Broseley, 
a town which enjoys similar planning and conservation controls to Ironbridge 
and as a result is similarly atmospheric.</p>

<p>Park at the bottom of 
Barratt's Hill <b>A</b> and walk northwards along Legge's (old name, 
Speeds) Lane. This is a rather narrow road and car parking is difficult. 
It is thought that this road followed the tramroad line. After 200 metres 
Legge's Lane kinks slightly to the right and may continue to follow 
the tramroad line. More likely however, is that the tramroad followed 
a line nearer the bottom of, what is at this point a dry valley. This 
would mean it would have passed through the property of Sloe Cottage, 
then through the back garden of number 14. Whichever route it took it 
would have passed through the property of Penn's Meadow, a large, 
new house situated where Legge's Lane turns sharply right and upwards. 
From this point northwards, the tramroad line is uncertain.
</p>

<p>Retrace your steps along 
Legge's Lane to its junction with Barratt's Hill <b>A</b>. This 
was the highest point reached by the tramroad. Across Barratt's Hill 
is a gateway into private land through which a hedge line can be seen 
heading southwards. The next access point is <b>B</b>, a third of a 
mile to the south, where a north/south hedge line, which marks the parish 
boundary is crossed by Chapel Lane. To get there, walk SE up Barratt's 
Hill; turn right into Chapel Lane; pass the 1741 Baptist Chapel on your 
right and continue downwards as the lane becomes unmade. (A public notice 
dated July 2006, announced the intention to modify the lane into a bridleway). 
The hedge line is beneath the second line of overhead power cables and 
it can be followed as it descends gently to the SSE along the shallow 
valley which, except at times of heavy rain is dry. The grass grows 
in tussocks and walking is not easy.</p>

<p>The tramroad's gentle 
descent was maintained across a declivity by an 85 metres long embankment <b>
C</b> with a hedge line bordering its western edge. In December 2006 
when I first visited this locality, I spoke to a dog walker. By a remarkable 
coincidence he was able, not only to point out the embankment but he 
recalled that, before the Second World War, it had rails on it. Although 
this helped me to locate the embankment, if he is correct about its 
use in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it raises questions that are unanswered.</p>

<p>At the point where the 
embankment enters Willey Park Wood, it is 12 metres high. Crossing the 
fence into the wood both the embankment and the path peter out amongst 
planted conifers. Following the line to the SSE it passes a small, disused 
quarry then crosses the Willey Hall (carriage) drive. There is no trace 
in the trees to the south of the drive. Emerging from the trees <b>D</b>, 
when the sun is low one can just make out the line, gently descending 
across the field to the B 4376. Google Earth's satellite images show 
this feature particularly well. (Note: permission to walk through Willey 
Park wood and cross the Willey Hall drive should be sought from Willey 
Estate office 01952 883946.)</p>

<p>The site of John Wilkinson's 
New Willey furnace is marked on the O.S. Explorer 242 map. A car can 
be parked beside the B 4376, Broseley to Much Wenlock road, just east 
of <em>The Round House</em> <b>E</b>, a recently restored octagonal tollhouse. 
Whether the tramway then crossed the road (probably about 6/8 feet above 
the present road level) to reach, then run along the causeway/dam at 
furnace-top level, or descended to the level of the furnace floor, is 
not known.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Steve 
Dewhirst of the Broseley Local History Society for his help. The 1838 
tithe map of Broseley can be viewed on the Society's web site at <a href="http://www.broseley.org.uk/TitheMap/tithe" target="_blank">www.broseley.org.uk</a>. 
The tithe map would seem to confirm the tramroad line (for much of its 
length following the parish boundary) though it does not mark it as 
a tramroad.</p>
