<h2>History</h2>
<p>On 9 July 1787 the world's 
first iron boat was launched at Willey Wharf on the River Severn in 
Shropshire. The boat was built by John Wilkinson (1) and named <em>Trial</em>. Thirty years earlier, 
in 1757, the New Willey Company was formed, with John Wilkinson as junior 
partner; and when their new ironworks, half a mile south of Broseley 
were opened in 1759 the Company  constructed a tramroad from there, 
eastwards for 3 miles to Willey Wharf (2). It was long believed that the more or less complete 
<em>Trial</em> was transported from New Willey Furnace to Willey Wharf along this tramroad. This is a romantic view. Opinion however, has changed 
and it is now thought more likely that the vessel was assembled then 
launched at Willey Wharf. The shift of opinion has come about partly 
because of the evidence of the tramway in Tarbatch Dingle (3). Here, 
the tramroad course, while descending on a narrow ledge along the side 
of a small ravine, also bends sharply from NE almost to SSE. Negotiating 
the 70 foot long by 6' 8.5" wide <em>Trial</em> at this point would have been 
very difficult indeed, and likely impossible for the much larger boat 
that Wilkinson reportedly launched soon afterwards (4).</p>

<p>The gazetteer of Bertram 
Baxter's <em>Stone Blocks and Iron Rails</em> says: <em><b>Willey Furnace 
Tramroad.</b> At Balls Foundry, south of Gitchfield Tile Works, west up 
Tarbatch Dingle to Willey Furnaces. 3 miles. No trace. (May have used 
the route of the earlier line to Rowton mines). Opened 1748. Track: 
wooden rails. Owner: George Weld, later John Wilkinson (1757)</em>. 
Although Baxter uses the name <em>Willey Furnace</em> for the tramroad, 
the name <em>Tarbatch Dingle Tramroad (or Railway)</em> is the one generally 
associated with it. Indeed, there is evidence of another tramroad leaving 
New Willey Furnace and heading NNW, with which the names <em>Benthall 
Railway</em> (5) and <em>Willey Furnace Tramroad</em> have been associated. Baxter gives 
the (original) rails as wooden but as early as 1767 in nearby Coalbrookdale, 
iron topped wooden rails were introduced, soon to be replaced by iron 
rails. It is likely that such an enthusiast for the use of iron as John 
Wilkinson would have been amongst the first to introduce such technology.
</p>
<h2>The Route</h2>
<table><tr valign="top"><td>
<p>The site of John Wilkinson's 
New Willey Furnace is marked on O.S. Explorer 242. A car can be parked 
beside the B 4376, Broseley to Much Wenlock road, just east of <em>The 
Round House</em> <b>A</b>, the recently restored octagonal tollhouse. 
This house is situated at the northern end of a causeway, possibly the 
furnace dam, but certainly it was a turnpike road to Willey village. 
It is likely that the tramroad, at furnace top level, left the works 
site along this causeway and, at <em>The Round House</em>, turned sharply 
east to pass along a bridleway which, though much overgrown is 11 metres 
wide, between two parallel lines of (scrub/coppiced) trees (6). Such a 
promising start soon ends at the B4373, beyond which <b>B</b> the ground 
rises sharply and an incline would have been necessary. At this point 
the B 4373 has been cut into the hillside and would have destroyed the 
lower part of the incline.  <br></p>

<p>Eastwards, agriculture 
has long since removed any tramroad remains. As there is no convenient 
footpath it is preferable to drive north to the Foresters Arms on the 
B4373 in Broseley and turn right into Pound Lane. This soon becomes 
the unmade (and unnamed) Caughley Road. Stop beneath the overhead electricity 
lines at <b>C</b>. Here, the tramroad reached its highest point as it 
crossed Caughley Road, the overhead electricity lines on each side indicating 
the tramroad line. The line then passes just north of Upper Riddings 
Farm and heads just south of Swinbatch but nothing can be seen on the 
ground.</p>
<p>The absence of a convenient 
footpath might suggest driving, either along the unmade/unnamed Red 
Lane towards Rowton House and stopping near Swinbatch 
(where parking is not easy), or taking the (recommended) longer 
drive to the eastern end of the tramroad. To do this follow Coalport 
Road eastwards towards Coalport Bridge. Shortly before the river bridge, 
the road crosses the old Severn Valley Railway <b>D</b>.  The yellow 
brick </em>Station House</em> is occupied; occupied too (in January 2008) 
were the two, carefully restored, chocolate and cream railway carriages 
in the garden. Turn right along the concrete track (signed Swinney) 
beside these carriages. This is the SVR course which soon passes a sewage 
works. From here the SVR course is rough but in regularly use. Park 
soon after passing the sewage works, on the railway bridge over Tarbatch 
Dingle <b>E.</b> (Note: Permission to walk in Tarbatch Dingle should 
be sought from the Willey Estate office 01952 883946).
</p>

<p>South of the brook is 
a rough track leading to Swinney Farm. On the north bank of the brook 
is a path, well disguised by growth that leads westwards into Tarbatch 
Dingle. In 120 metres two, small disused quarries are passed on the 
right and then the brook is crossed. The valley narrows and steepens 
and the path becomes a ledge. Approaching the bend <b>F</b> growth, 
even in winter makes for slow progress. Being on the <em>inside</em> of 
the bend, the path is forced to turn sharply through more than 90 degrees. 
The path condition improves and towards the top of the dingle, game 
bird pens are passed. Swinbatch (no longer a farm) is seen through the 
trees on the right. Where the path is blocked, walk at the edge of the 
arable field on the south side of the path which passes to the south 
of a small pool to end at an old, sunken track. To the west, all traces 
have gone. Either return down Tarbatch Dingle or turn north, along the 
sunken track to reach the Swinbatch access track then NNW to reach Red 
Lane then WNW to Coalport Road.
</p>
<p>At <b>E</b> the building 
of the SVR would have obliterated the tramroad which hereabouts must 
have recrossed the brook. To the east of the SVR, an earthen track descends 
gently to the site of Willey Wharf, and the two semi detached cottages 
shown on O.S Explorer 242 as <em>Ballsfoundry</em>. In 2000 they bore the 
names <em>Numbers 1 and 2 Foundry Cottages</em> but in January 2008 they 
were unnamed. Neither cottage gives any indication of an earlier use 
and it is believed that the iron foundry stood to the rear of the cottages. 
The wharf is thought to have been just to the north of the cottages.</p>

<p>Wilkinson had built his first iron boat several years earlier for use 
on Helton Tarn, near Cartmel in Cumbria</p>

<p>  
There is documentary evidence of an earlier tramroad from Rowton mines, 
down Tarbatch Dingle to the River Severn and that 
Wilkinson used this route for the eastern part of his Tarbatch Dingle 
Tramroad</p>

<p>The name <em>Tarbatch</em>, originates from the mineral oil deposits that 
were found there</p>

<p>A letter from John Wilkinson in October 1787 mentions two more iron 
vessels, one a barge of 40 tons, launched at Willey Wharf.</p>

Occasional Paper <em>Benthall Railway, Shropshire</em></p>

<p>The 1759 lease gave permission to lay a <em>double railway that does 
not exceed in breadth ten yards</em>. The reason for this  extraordinary 
width is not known.</p>
