	<h1>Buildwas Abbey</h1>
</div>

<p>Buildwas Abbey was founded in the 12th century by the Sauvignacs and taken over almost immediately by the Cistercian order. It was built over a hundred years or so, and thereafter not much altered. Despite occasional raids by the Welsh, it continued in good order until surrendered to Henry VIII.</p>
