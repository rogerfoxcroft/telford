<p>This site is dedicated to promoting interest in the New Town  of Telford, and especially in the visible, <a href="#footnote1">visitable</a> remains of the transport system which underpinned its industrial history. <span class="b">Come and visit us!</span> I'm an immigrant to Shropshire, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, so if I tell you it's a great place to live or to visit, you can believe me. Known as The Birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, it is full of historical interest, places to visit and things to see.</cite>

<p>When I had surveyed the routes of the canal and railway systems which used to support the local economy, I became interested in the Iron Bridge. That led to an interest in other iron bridges. Meanwhile, I was receiving questions about Shropshire as well as about Telford itself. So it came about, that not eveything on the site now relates to Telford.</cite>

<h3>Visitable</h3>
<p><cite>I am told that the word &quot;visitable&quot; is used by the Disable Rights movement to indicate, visitable by people in wheelchairs or with impaired mobility. However, I use it in its everyday sense, meaning that the places I describe can be reached by an ordinarily able-bodied person: a reading of the text will make it quite clear that whilst some are easily reached, others are anything but! Anyone who wishes to know more about the accessibility of anything I describe, or indeed any place in Telford, is invited to <a href="http://www.telfordsites.co.uk/mailto.html">contact me</a> and I will try to help. -RF</cite>
