<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="Dedicated to promoting interest in the New Town  of Telford, and especially in the visible, visitable remains of its industrial history. Come and visit us! I'm an immigrant to Shropshire, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, so if I tell you it's a great place to live or to visit, you can believe me. Known as The Birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, it is full of historical interest, places to visit and things to see.">

			<h6><b>Note: <em>Certain correspondents have complained that we have included in <b></em>Exploring Telford<em></b> places outside the new town: we acknowledge we have strayed into the surrounding area, and even further afield. As neither Telford town, nor the Borough of Telford and the Wrekin existed at the time the canals and railways which are the main focus of this site were in service, we do not feel constrained by their boundaries.</em></h6>
